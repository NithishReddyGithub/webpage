            <h1>Who is a Software Developer</h1>
            <p> A developer is an individual that builds and create software and applications. He or she writes,
                debugs
                and executes the source code of a software application.
                A developer is also known as a software developer, computer programmer, programmer, software coder
                or
                software engineer. <br>
                A developer is the key individual behind all software applications. Generally, developers are well
                versed in at least one programming language and proficient in the art of structuring and developing
                software code for software or a program. Depending on job role and type of software developed, a
                developer may be classified as a software developer, application developer, mobile developer, Web
                developer, etc.
                Although the primary job role is writing code, a developer also may gather requirements for
                software,
                design or overall software architecture, software documentation and other related software
                development
                processes.

            <h1>Skills or Degree</h1>
            <p> Degree and skill are two sides of the same coin. To succeed in the race of life, a person need to
                have a
                degree along with the skill. A degree without the skill would be as empty as the skill without the
                degree. Both need to go hand-in-hand in order to be the survival of the fittest. Degree is nothing
                but
                the certified documentation of the skill within the individual. Every person having the skill may
                not
                manage to attain the degree. Similarly, every degree holder is not necessarily skilled. The
                requirement
                of the degree or skill depends upon the organization, the nature of post etc. On a general outlook,
                which criteria carries more weightage – the degree or the skill? <br>
                Degree is the theoretical evaluation of an abstract concept which is virtually not possible. It is
                the
                skill that helps the person to grow up both materially / financially and immaterially with respect
                to
                the status, importance, social respect and recognition etc. Degree definitely has its own
                importance, as
                a person need to have some skill in order to achieve the degree. A complete dumb individual cannot
                qualify to attain the degree. Hence , we can summarize by saying that the degree is the first step
                in
                the ladder of skills which leads to the success in life.
